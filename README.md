# cowin_availability
This is an automated self alert tool which will notify you once vaccine is available for the selected region

Intented to notify once vaccines are available for 18+ / 45+ by beeping in your personal computer as we cannot always keep refreshing the cowin portal											
This will not automatically schedule appointments, it will only notify you the availablity and we have to manually schedule from https://selfregistration.cowin.gov.in/
This can notify and show availability for any of the vaccines from today, sample entry in Availability will be as below (Latest entry being at last)											
Available at Apollo Proton COVAXIN Quantity 1					5/15/2021 17:48						
Ensure that your system sound is turned on and in full volume so that you do not miss any notification.
